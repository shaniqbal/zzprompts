PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of 
collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and 
linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may 
be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed 
freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative 
works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided 
that any reserved names are not used by derivative works.
